# Syncord
Syncord is an open-source third-party Discord client for ROBLOX executor Synapse X.

Similar to the Discord game overlay, you will be able to read and send messages to servers, direct messages and group chats all from within ROBLOX!

## How to use!
It's 2 easy steps to get going!

1. Execute the loader in Synapse X
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionSystemsLLC/Syncord/main/loader.lua"))()
```

2. Enter your Discord account token, and press enter.

And you're in! Easy right?

*In order to maintain user privacy, your account token is not shared, and is deleted immediately once Syncord is closed.*

While there have been not yet been any documented cases brought to our attention regarding terminated accounts as a result of using Syncord, however it is advised that you use an alternative account so that in such an event, your main account is not terminated.
